# Lab Prerequisite Setup

* Install JDK 11 (we used [Eclipse Temurin OpenJDK 11 LTS](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk11)).
* Install [the 2020-03 release of Eclipse for Enterprise Java Developers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2020-03/r/eclipse-ide-enterprise-java-developers-includes-incubating-components) (this is the latest Eclipse IDE version that supports Java SE 8 and works reliably with WebLogic 12.2.1.3).
* Install WebLogic 12.2.1.3 (note - not the latest version) using the Quick Installer by downloading it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/middleware/technologies/weblogic-server-downloads.html).
* Download this repository somewhere in your file system (easiest way might be to download as a zip and extract).
* You will need an Azure subscription. If you don't have one, you can get one for free for one year [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free).

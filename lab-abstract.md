# Effective Kubernetes for Jakarta EE and MicroProfile Developers

There are several key techniques to understand while using Kubernetes with Jakarta EE and MicroProfile applications. Examples include:

* How Kubernetes primitives (such as deployments and services) align with application server administration, clustering, auto-discovery, and load-balancing.
* How to add self-healing capabilities using Kubernetes probes and monitoring with open source tools like Prometheus.
* How the CI/CD pipeline of your application can be adapted to Kubernetes.
* How Kubernetes can be extended using Operators to effectively manage application server clusters.

This entirely slide-free demo-driven session walks through each of these considerations in turn. At the end of the session, you will have all the demos on GitHub so you can explore them on your own.

There are several key techniques to understand while using Kubernetes with Jakarta EE and MicroProfile applications. Examples include:

* How Kubernetes primitives (such as `Deployment`s, `Service`s etc.) align with application server administration, clustering, auto-discovery, and load-balancing.
* How to add self-healing capabilities using Kubernetes probes and monitoring with open source tools like Prometheus.
* How the CI/CD pipeline of your application can be adapted to Kubernetes.
* Kubernetes-native application servers: How can Kubernetes be extended using Custom Resource Definitions (and Controllers) to manage application server clusters.

This fast-paced, demo-driven session walks through each of these considerations in turn.

# Effective Kubernetes for Jakarta EE and MicroProfile Developers

There are several key techniques to understand while using Kubernetes with Jakarta EE and MicroProfile applications. Examples include:

* How Kubernetes primitives (such as `Deployment`s, `Service`s etc.) align with application server administration, clustering, auto-discovery, and load-balancing.
* How to add self-healing capabilities using Kubernetes probes and monitoring with open source tools like Prometheus.
* How the CI/CD pipeline of your application can be adapted to Kubernetes.
* Kubernetes-native application servers: How can Kubernetes be extended using Custom Resource Definitions (and Controllers) to manage application server clusters.

This fast-paced, demo-driven session walks through each of these considerations in turn.
